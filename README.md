# Challenge-Show-Flags-
This challenge was to create an app that lists various world flags on a table view. When one of them is tapped, slide on a detail view controller that contains an image view, showing the same flag full size. On the detail view controller, I added an action button that lets the user share the flag picture and country name using UIActivityViewController.
